	<p>The bungalow is set a fair way back from the road. There is actually a green in front and a pavement between the green and the bungalow's front garden. </p>
	<p>At the back of the bungalow there is a parking area and garages servicing about six bungalows. You can access the parking area via another road and park your car adjacent to the back of the garden fence, you then access the bungalow through the back gate, and up the garden path. </p>
	<p>We hardly ever use the front door unless we're going out on foot. </p>
	<p>As you can see, this arrangement makes it very safe for children because there is no road for them to easily run into and it is also very quiet. It is also very safe for your car because no one can see it from the road, not that it is an unsafe area by any means. </p>
