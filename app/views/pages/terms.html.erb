		<p><strong>Our contract </strong></p>
		<p>When you place a booking with islandretreat.co.uk you will receive an email confirming availability and price. A booking made through the website will be held for a maximum of seven days until either a deposit or full payment is received. Full payment must be received at least six weeks before the arrival date after which time islandretreat reserves the right to re-advertise the holiday and all monies paid by the customer will be forfeited.</p>
		<p>Islandretreat endeavors to provide you with accommodation as described within the website and in full working order. In the unlikely event that this is not possible due to breakages or breakdowns that have occured during a previous rental period, we will make an assessment as to whether we can provide you with accommodation that meets your expectations, if not then a full refund will be applied. </p>
		<p><strong>Cancellations</strong></p>
		<p>Once a booking has been placed any payment made to islandretreat to secure the booking is non-refundable. In the event that islandretreat cancels a booking a full refund will be applied. </p>
		<p><strong>Pricing and Availability </strong></p>
		<p>We list availability on the website. This is as accurate as we can possibly make it but we reserve the right to refuse a booking on the grounds of unavailability despite the website stating the contrary. We may advertise holidays elsewhere at a different price to that advertised on the website. Once we have accepted a booking the price is fixed. </p>
